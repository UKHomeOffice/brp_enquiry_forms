      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>some common personal details like name, date of birth and address may not autocomplete with the user’s details -
          this does not meet WCAG success criterion 1.3.5 (Identify Input Purpose)</li>
        <li>not all pages identify the language used as English - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 3.1.1 (Language
          of Page)</li>
        <li>some text on the final confirmation page is not sufficiently colour contrasted against the background - this
          does not meet WCAG success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast - minimum)</li>
        <li>typeaheads are announced as ‘disabled’ or ‘read only’ even though they are not - this does not meet WCAG success
          criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role Value)</li>
        <li>the guidance read out on how to correctly populate date fields is incorrect - this does not meet WCAG success
          criterion 3.3.2 (Labels and Instructions)</li>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>date fields do not use unique IDs, which may make it harder for assistive technologies to accurately interpret
          text - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Non-accessible content found in ‘My BRP has not been delivered’</strong></p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the link text to contact UK Visas and Immgration does not clearly communicate the link’s purpose - this does not

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>some radio buttons do not have unique IDs, which may make it harder for assistive technologies to accurately
          interpret text - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing)</li>
        <li>date fields have incorrect aria labels - this does not meet WCAG 1.3.1 (Info and relationships) and WCAG success
          criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)</li>
